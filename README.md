# Hello.

Much like the exploration of Mars and the moon, Rovers are used to collect samples and analyze such samples to further explore the unknowns. Unlike Mars, over 80% of the oceans havenâ€™t been fully analyzed and scanned even in the present. The primary reason for the lack of explored regions is given with how current solutions are either too cumbersome or require too much time to function. With Project NEPTUNE, we hope to make self-sustaining deployables that can be sent as fleets equipped with different equipment that accelerate the exploration of the ocean.

## What really is NEPTUNE?

With Project NEPTUNE, we hope to create prototypes that demonstrate a more efficient way of exploring the vast bottoms of the ocean. Through autonomous programming and sophisticated design dedicated to collecting samples and scanning the ocean, we can create deployable mini submarines that can collect samples autonomously without the presence of humans. The limiting of human interaction increases safety, time efficiency, and much more.

## okay, but what is this github page?

NEPTUNE is an open-source project. Licensed with MIT, the code is available to be modified and used in your own projects and other stuff the license says blah blah blah. have fun!
